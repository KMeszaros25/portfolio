I am still working on getting all of the repositories for past projects to be public, as I am not the owner of some of them. In the meantime, here is a list of links to the final products of all of my projects:
- Clearing Blackwaters (Data+ project): [[poster](Saltwater_Intrusion_Poster.pptx.pdf)] [[website](http://18.208.248.243/)] [[analysis only](https://clearingblackwaters.shinyapps.io/rshinyapp/)]
